# JS++
A JavaScript mentoring programme for seasoned developers

## Contents 

- Week 0: Orientation
- Week 1: Introduction to Node
- Week 2: CommonJS and Continuation Passing Style

## Who is this for?

This programme is aimed at developers proficient in at least one language, 
but with little or no working knowledge of JavaScript.

While you can try working through the exercises alone, I recommend pairing 
up with a mentor who has more JavaScript experience. They will be able to 
help you if you get stuck, review your code and suggest improvements. They
might also be able to improve on the example solutions provided in this repo.

## Getting started

I recommend creating a fork of this repository and cloning it to your development
machine. Work through the exercises week by week. Any code should be added to the
directory for the week you are working on.

When you have finished an exercise, push your changes to your remote repository 
and review your solution with your mentor.
