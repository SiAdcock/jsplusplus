### Learning JavaScript Design Patterns

The final resource is a book called [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) by [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani). Addy is currently working on the Google Chrome team. Start you off by reading the chapters on the [Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript) and the [Revealing Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript).  These will give you an introduction to Modules, the basic building blocks of JavaScript applications. In this chapter, we learn how things used to be, before module bundlers were common in the browser. All code was global. The Module Pattern gave us a sane way of namespacing parts of our applications, and also gave us some privacy.

## Environment

Do you have NVM installed? Try running:

```bash
$ nvm
```

If not, [install it](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script). NVM allows you to run multiple versions of Node, and easily switch between them

Install the most recent version of Node (v10) using NVM:

```bash
$ nvm install 10
```
